      <h4 class="text-center"><strong>The Career Timeline of Kobe Bryant:</strong></h4>
      <ul>
        <li> July 11, 1996: Unveiled by the Lakers After expressing his unwillingness to suit up for the Charlotte Hornets, who drafted him 13th overall in 1996, Los Angeles Lakers owner Jerry West shipped center Vlade Divac to Charlotte for Kobe Bryant, who
          was unveiled to the L.A. media 10 days later.
        </li>
        <li>
          June 19, 2000: The first championship A 21-year-old Bryant averaged 15.6 points, 4.2 assists, and 4.6 rebounds in the 2000 NBA Finals, including a 26-point, 10-rebound performance in the deciding Game 6 against the Indiana Pacers, to win his first NBA
          title.
        </li>
        <li>January 15, 2001: Triple-double No. 1 Fighting his way out of Shaquille O'Neal's (massive) shadow in 2000, Bryant made a legitimate case for his own stardom with the first of 21 triple-doubles in his career, racking up 26 points, 11 assists, and
          11 rebounds in a 113-112 win against the Vancouver Grizzlies.
        </li>
        <li>June 15, 2001: Winning a second consecutive title Kobe and Shaq asserted themselves as the NBA's most dominant duo again, downing Allen Iverson and his Philadelphia 76ers in the Finals. Bryant finished with 26 points and 12 rebounds in Game 5
          to put the series to rest.
        </li>
        <li>
          June 12, 2002: Three-peat The 2002-03 Lakers became only the fifth team in NBA history to win three consecutive championships when they steamrolled the New Jersey Nets, sweeping them in four games behind Bryant's 26.8 points per game.
          <li>January 22, 2006: 81 No Bryant-career retrospective is complete without mentioning the night he single-handedly took down the Toronto Raptors with an <strong>81-point show</strong>, the most points in one game after Wilt Chamberlain scored 100
            in 1962.
          </li>
          <li>
            March 16-23, 2007: Four straight games with 50+ points Bryant couldn't be stopped when he put up four straight games of at least 50 points against the Portland Trailblazers (65), Minnesota Timberwolves (50), Memphis Grizzlies (60), and New Orleans/Oklahoma
            City Hornets (50) in March 2007.
          </li>
          <li>June 14, 2009: Championship No. 4, the first sans Shaq Critics who said he couldn't do it without O'Neal were silenced when Bryant led the Lakers over the Orlando Magic in five games, scoring at least 30 points in all but one game in the 2009
            Finals.
          </li>
          <li>June 17, 2010: Fifth Time In what looks to be his final conquest of an NBA title, Bryant averaged 28.6 points and eight rebounds per game in the 2010 NBA Finals against the Boston Celtics, claiming his <strong>fifth</strong> Larry O'Brien Trophy.
          </li>
          <li>
            April 12, 2013: The beginning of the fall In a move he had made "a million times," Bryant tore his Achilles tendon in a freak injury against the Golden State Warriors, ruling him out for the rest of the season. He recovered in time for the following season,
            but never returned to his dominant ways.
          </li>
          <li>
            November 29, 2015: Full circle Just after facing the team he defeated for his first NBA championship in the Pacers, Bryant addressed reporters after announcing earlier in the day that 2015-16 would be his final season.
          </li>
          <li>
            April 13, 2016: In Kobe's last game in NBA, he turned back the time and finish with 60 points, putting on a miracle ending on his hall of frame career!
